# -JWST-data-analysis-workshop-transiting-exoplanets
Notebook created for the STScI Spring Symposium 2023 'Planetary systems and the origins of life in the era of JWST'. 

The notebook provides a basic step-by-step guide to analyzing JWST data using **ERS NIRSpec PRISM WASP-39b** transit observations. 
It requires the installation of certain Python packages such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and the jwst pipeline. For users who wish to delve deeper, we suggest installing juliet and transitspectroscopy.
