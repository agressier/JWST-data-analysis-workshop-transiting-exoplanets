# -JWST-data-analysis-workshop-transiting-exoplanets
Notebook created for the STScI Spring Symposium 2023 'Planetary systems and the origins of life in the era of JWST'. 

We explore simple steps off data analysis using ERS NIRSpec PRISM WASP-39b transit observations.

The notebook requires --numpy,scipy, matplotlib and jwst pipeline--, however if you want to go further, we suggest installing --juliet-- and --transitspectroscopy--
